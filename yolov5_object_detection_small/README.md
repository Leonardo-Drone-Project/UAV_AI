- The YOLOv5s model is a lightweight, real-time object detection model from the YOLOv5 family, developed by Ultralytics. 

- It balances speed and performance, making it ideal for edge devices and UAV-based inference where compute resources and latency are constrained.

- It should detect and localise humans, trees, and other objects in an open-field environment via drone-mounted cameras.

- This will serve as the first stage in a detect-then-track pipeline, feeding into a tracker for persistent UAV target tracking.
